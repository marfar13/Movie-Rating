# Movie-Rating

SQL Analysis:
In this project, I analyzed the IMDb movie dataset using SQL. The dataset contains information about various movies, including their titles, release years, genres, ratings, and more. Leveraging SQL queries, I extracted valuable insights from the dataset by exploring trends over time, identifying the most popular genres, and examining the distribution of ratings. I formulated complex queries to answer specific questions about the dataset, such as determining the average rating for each genre, finding the top-rated movies, and analyzing the voting patterns over the years.

Power BI Visualization:
In addition to SQL analysis, I visualized the IMDb movie dataset using Power BI. I created a series of interactive visualizations to provide intuitive insights into the dataset's key metrics and trends. These visualizations include line charts depicting the evolution of IMDb ratings and the number of votes over time, stacked column charts showcasing the distribution of movie genres and age certificates, and box plots illustrating the distribution of movie runtimes and IMDb ratings across different genres. Each visualization is accompanied by interactive filters, allowing users to dynamically explore the data by selecting specific years or time intervals.
